## Features

This application includes several dedicated modules:

* **üí° Ohm's Law Calculator:** Quickly solve for voltage, current, or resistance in basic DC circuits.
* **‚ö° AC Series RLC Circuit Analyzer:** A comprehensive tool that calculates impedance, phase angle, power factor, and resonance. It also provides an interactive plot of the voltage and current waveforms.
* **üìä RC Low-Pass Filter Analyzer:** Design and analyze a simple low-pass filter. The tool calculates the cutoff frequency and generates a professional Bode plot of the magnitude response.
* **üîå BJT Common-Emitter Amplifier:** Perform DC Q-point and AC small-signal analysis on a standard voltage-divider biased BJT amplifier.
* **ü§ñ Digital Logic Gate Simulator:** A simple simulator for basic logic gates including AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and NOT.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Streamlit**: For creating and deploying the interactive web interface.
* **NumPy**: For numerical calculations and array manipulation.
* **Matplotlib**: For generating the plots in the AC RLC and RC Filter modules.
